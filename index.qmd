# :wave: Hi, I'm Collin

I'm a media research analyst, data enthusiast, and news, sports, and podcast aficianado. 

Professionally, I use data, audience measurement, and marketing research methods to answer questions on how to best reach and engage audiences--towards the goal of enriching lives and engaging minds with public media content and services. I am particularly interested in the use and development of open-source statistical software (i.e. [R](https://www.r-project.org/)) to achieve this goal, and gaining a broader understanding of the role these tools play in media, digital, and marketing analytics. I also adjunct university courses on the side. 

Listening to [NPR](https://www.npr.org/), watching [PBS](https://www.pbs.org/) (especially [NOVA](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/)), and college football and baseball are my jam.
