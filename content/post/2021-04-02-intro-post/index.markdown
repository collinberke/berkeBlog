# Hello World!

I have decided to start writing a blog. I have never attempted anything like this before, but I felt it was time to start organizing some of my projects and analyses into one central location. For some time, I really wanted to develop a space where I could discuss topics I find interesting, both professionally and personally. So, `Hello World!`, my name is Collin, and this is my blog. 

I'm also on other platforms, however, I really don't engage on them too often. Nevertheless, you can find more information about me and my projects in the following locations:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/collinberke) is a great place to see the projects I am working on. Most are professional at this time.
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BerkeCollin), I haven't posted anything in a while, though I retweet and like stuff often. 
* Email, the best channel to get a hold of me: collin.berke@gmail.com. 

# The purpose of this blog

The purpose of this blog is to serve as a location for me to express my thoughts on topics I find interesting. To be honest, I don't expect this to be a really niche blog with one focused, clear purpose. Most likely it will be data analysis and/or visualization focused, which I will apply to develop posts in areas I find interesting: open-source software, media/marketing analytics, data analysis, sports, media, etc. My purpose may become more refined once I find my voice. 

# The inspiration and motivation to do this blog

I have spent countless hours reading, re-reading, bookmarking, and Googling multiple topics regarding the use of the statistical computing programming language called [`R`](https://www.r-project.org/). Much of this time has been spent accessing useful, open-source, and free content that has aided me professionally, and it has contributed to my deeper understanding of the topics I find interesting. I couldn't even begin to describe how grateful I am for those who have spent time organizing and drafting content others find useful. In fact, it's the [`#Rstats`](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Rstats&src=typed_query) community that has motivated me to put this blog together, as I have seen how helpful and open it is to aiding in the development of others.

I now feel I am in a place of not only being a consumer but a producer of this information. I will never be an expert in this area, as there is too much to learn for just one person. As one of my favorite podcasts (i.e., [_Make Me Smart With Kai and Molly_](https://www.marketplace.org/shows/make-me-smart-with-kai-and-molly/)) states in every episode, "None of us is as smart as all of us." Thus, I feel it is time to start organizing and drafting content others will hopefully find useful, at the very least amusing. Even if this blog helps one person, that will be enough motivation to keep me working on it.  

# What's up next?

Not sure. I'm just excited I got this blog up and running. Most likely I'll do something sports related. Who knows--stay tuned.
