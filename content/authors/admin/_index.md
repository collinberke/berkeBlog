Collin K. Berke, Ph.D. is a media research analyst in public media. Professionally, he uses data, audience measurement, and marketing research methods to answer questions on how to best reach and engage audiences--towards the goal of enriching lives and engaging minds with public media content and services. He is especially interested in the use and development of open-source statistical software (i.e. [`Rstats`](https://www.r-project.org/)) to achieve this goal, and developing a broader understanding the role these tools can play in media, digital, and marketing analytics.

Collin is a self-proclaimed news, sports, and podcast junkie. He really enjoys listening to [NPR](https://www.npr.org/) and watching college football and baseball.
