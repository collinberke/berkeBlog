## Projects I'm working on

#### **Project Conduit** 

Currently developing a data pipeline project built using R and Python. Technology utilized includes Google Cloud resources, Docker, Apache Airflow, Google BigQuery, Google Analytics, Google Data Studio, and Shiny. The goal is to centralize and automate data processing, storage, and reporting.  

#### **R for Data Science Online Learning Community book club facilitator**

Currently facilitating a [R for Data Science Online Learning Community](https://www.rfordatasci.com/) online book club (check it out by joining the [Slack](http://r4ds.io/join)). This group is currently reading through Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan's [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/) book. The group meets weekly online over Zoom. Meetings are open to anyone who is a part of the Slack group (Join the #bookclubs-rpkgs channel to keep up with the book club). Check out this playlist of recordings for our weekly meetings [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3x6DOfs2NGi8NcKmNxw_Hk4-leUsivZv). I would love to see more people join the group. 

## Books I'm reading

#### [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/) by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan

I'm reading this book as part of the R for Data Science Online Learning Community book club. See the 'Projects I'm working on' section for some more detail. 

#### [Vim help files](https://vimhelp.org/) maintained by Carlo Teubner

I constantly focus on new ways to improve my workflows and become more efficient. One means for improving my productivity is to learn and practice using the Vim text editor. I've been bitten by the Vim bug (help!). I've been reading the docs to learn more. Check out my recent TIL post on how to set up the Vim key bindings in R Studio. You might just find yourself using Vim as your preferred text editor in your terminal.

#### [Mastering Ubuntu](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Ubuntu-Server-configuring-troubleshooting/dp/1800564643) by Jay LaCroix

More and more I'm finding myself managing compute engines running some form of Ubuntu, a version of Linux. To get better at managing these resources and to make myself more efficient in these environments, I'm reading this book to learn and practice my skills.  

#### [The Galaxy, and the Ground Within: A Novel (Wayfarers 4)](https://www.amazon.com/Galaxy-Ground-Within-Novel-Wayfarers-ebook/dp/B088RDCLQ4) by Becky Chambers

Another sci-fi read for fun. Set at Five-Hop One-Stop, an average long-haul spacer stop on the planet Gora, a freak technological failure halts a trio of spacefaring strangers. During their time together, these strangers are compelled to confront where they've been, where they might go, and what they are, or could be, to each other. I suggest reading the first three books in this series before diving into this read.
