## Projects I'm working on

#### **Project Conduit** 

Currently developing and maintaining a data pipeline project built using R and Python. Technology utilized includes Google Cloud resources, Docker, Apache Airflow, Google BigQuery, Google Analytics, Google Data Studio, and Shiny. The goal is to centralize and automate data processing, storage, and reporting.  

#### **R for Data Science Online Learning Community book club facilitator**

Currently facilitating a [R for Data Science Online Learning Community](https://www.rfordatasci.com/) online book club (check it out by joining the [Slack](http://r4ds.io/join)). This group is currently reading through Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan's [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/) book. The group meets weekly online over Zoom. Meetings are open to anyone who is a part of the Slack group (Join the #bookclubs-rpkgs channel to keep up with the book club). Check out this playlist of recordings for our weekly meetings [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3x6DOfs2NGi8NcKmNxw_Hk4-leUsivZv). I would love to see more people join the group. 

#### Experimenting with [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)

I've been experimenting more and more with Neovim for my development work. I'm happy and becoming more comfortable with the different modes and tools for editing text and code. Still struggling through the configuration and plugin ecosystem to set up workflows that are the most productive. Going through this process has been a challenge, but has me really reflecting on how I approach my work and evaluating what is needed, not needed, and what are the bad habits I need to break.  

## Books I'm reading

#### [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/) by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan

I'm reading this book as part of the R for Data Science Online Learning Community book club. See the 'Projects I'm working on' section for some more detail.

#### [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/index.html) by Hadley Wickham

Doing another read through of this book, as I'm leading my work team through the material. Our aim is to start developing more Shiny applications to communicate our work and analyses. As such, we are focusing on learning the basics of Shiny app development. 

#### [Regression and other stories](https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/) by Andrew Gelman, Jennifer Hill, and Aki Vehtari

Slowly reading through this book. It's been some time since I've focused on developing my modelling skills, so I was wanting to spend some more time developing in this area.  

#### [Leviathon Wakes (The Expanse Book 1)](https://www.amazon.com/Leviathan-Wakes-Expanse-Book-1-ebook/dp/B0047Y171G) by James S.A. Corey

Another sci-fi read for fun. Centered on a secret with the capacity to start an all out war within the solar system, the characters Jim Holden, an ice miner, and Detective Miller, a man on the hunt for a central key to this secret, find themselves confronted with its weight and potential impact. An exciting read so far. So exciting that the book was adapted into a telelvision series, which I have not seen yet.
