## Projects I'm working on

#### Experimenting more with Tableau and `plotly`

> If the only tool you have is a hammer, it is tempting to treat everything as if it were a nail. 
>
> \- Abraham Maslow

Although I prefer to do the majority of my analysis and visualization work using code based tools like R, I'm attempting to broaden my experience by experimenting more with different BI tools. This includes [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/). I've also been experimenting with creating interactive data visualizations with [`plotly`](https://plotly.com/r/). To develop these skills, I've been contributing to the [#tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) social data project. Check out my recent [blog posts](https://www.collinberke.com/blog/) to view my contributions. If you're interested in what I've created using Tableau, check out my [public profile](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/collin.berke/vizzes).

#### Burning it all down and building it back up, my [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) setup

It was inevitable; I'm revamping my Neovim configuration. It started with a kickstarter, but now I'm looking to further customize. I'm also attempting to address some bugs that have creeped into my configuration. I've recently come to the conclusion that I need to burn everything down and start anew. Alas, I'm not weary. It's another great learning experience.

#### Attended [Posit::conf(2023)](https://posit.co/conference/) Chicago

I was fortunate to attend this year's Posit conference in Chicago, a five day conference with workshops and speaker sessions. I'm still sorting through all that I learned. Here are some of the highlights:

* Attending the Introduction to Tidymodels workshop
* Attending the Package Development Masterclass workshop
* All the keynote speakers, especially J.D. Long's *It's Abstractions All the Way Down* talk.
* Networking and meeting some folks from the [R4DS Online Learning Community](https://rfordatasci.com/) (in person).

## Books I'm reading

#### [Practical Tableau](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Tableau-Tutorials-Strategies-Master/dp/1491977310) by Ryan Sleeper

Since I'm broadening my data visualization skills, I've picked up this book to develop my foundational understanding of Tableau. Reading this has also broadened my understanding of general data visualization concepts. In truth, I've gained a better understanding by seeing how other tools approach the creation of data visualizations.

#### [Machine Learning with R - Fourth Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-cleansing-modeling-tidyverse/dp/1801071322/) by Brett Lantz 

This is a bit of a stretch read for me. I read this book when I have the time. I'm mostly using it to become more familiar with other machine learning models and techniques available in R. I'm also looking to write some more blog posts utilizing machine learning. Again, when I can find the time.

#### [The Robots of Dawn (The Robot Series 3)](https://www.amazon.com/Robots-Dawn-Robot-Isaac-Asimov/dp/0553299492/) by Isaac Asimov 

I'm continuing to read more of The Robot Series from Issac Asimov. More robots, another case to solve, and all within the sci-fi genre. I've become a bit of a fan of this series.
