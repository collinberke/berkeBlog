## Projects I'm working on

#### It's a Python summer

This summer I've been focusing on developing my [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming skills. I have a pretty good handle of R, so I felt it was time to learn Python. This started with learning Python's basic data types, struggling through understanding [Numpy arrays](https://numpy.org/doc/1.25/), getting a handle on the extensive use cases of the [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library, and learning how to manage environments using [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/). I'm aiming to write more blog posts focused in this space to document what I'm learning.

#### Continuing to experiment with [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)

I've heavily leaned into using [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) for most of my workflows. During this transition, I've come across some really useful tools, like [`telescope`](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim), [`harpoon`](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon), and [`vim-fugitive`](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive). I'm trying to learn as much as I can, as I still don't know if my configuration is correct ... lol

#### Project Conduit 

I'm currently developing and maintaining a data pipeline project built using R and Python. Technology utilized includes Google Cloud resources, Docker, Apache Airflow, Google BigQuery, Google Analytics, Google Data Studio, and Shiny. The goal is to centralize and automate data processing, storage, and reporting.  

## Books I'm reading

#### [Python for Data Analysis](https://wesmckinney.com/book/) by Wes McKinney

Being that it is a Python summer, I picked up this book as a starter to learn and practice using Python for data analysis. Currently, I'm working through the data cleaning, preparation, and wrangling material. I'm hoping to get to the chapters on modelling towards the end of the summer. 

#### [Regression and other stories](https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/) by Andrew Gelman, Jennifer Hill, and Aki Vehtari

Slowly reading through this book. It's been some time since I've focused on developing my modelling skills, so I was wanting to spend more time reading some material in this space.  

#### [Persepolis Rising (The Expanse book 7)](https://www.amazon.com/Persepolis-Rising-Expanse-James-Corey/dp/0316332852)

This is a personal Sci-Fi read. I've found I haven't had much time for personal reading as of much lately. I want to finish this series, so I pick it up from time-to-time.
