## Projects I'm working on

#### Project Conduit 

Currently developing and maintaining a data pipeline project built using R and Python. Technology utilized includes Google Cloud resources, Docker, Apache Airflow, Google BigQuery, Google Analytics, Google Data Studio, and Shiny. The goal is to centralize and automate data processing, storage, and reporting.  

#### R for Data Science Online Learning Community book club facilitator

Recently started facilitating an [R for Data Science Online Learning Community](https://www.rfordatasci.com/) online book club (check it out by joining the [Slack workspace](http://r4ds.io/join)). This group is currently reading through Hadley Wickham's [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) book. The group meets weekly online over Zoom. Meetings are open to anyone who is a part of the Slack group (Join the #book_club-advr channel to keep up with the book club). Check out the playlist of past meeting recordings [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfTg6upHvO4&list=PL3x6DOfs2NGi4I1DhjPufFNbqCry_xQLq). I would love for more to join and be a part of this group. 

#### Experimenting with [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)

I've been experimenting more and more with Neovim for my development work. I'm becoming more comfortable with the different modes, movements, actions, and various tools for editing text and code. Still struggling through the configuration and plugin ecosystem to set up workflows that are the most productive. Going through this process has been a challenge, but has me really reflecting on how I approach my work, evaluating what is needed, not needed, and focusing on the bad habits I need to break.  

## Books I'm reading

#### [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham

I'm reading this book as part of the R for Data Science Online Learning Community book club. See the 'Projects I'm working on' section for some more detail.

#### [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/index.html) by Hadley Wickham

Doing another read through of this book, as I'm leading my work team through the material. Our aim is to start developing more Shiny applications to communicate our work and analyses. As such, we are focusing on learning the basics of Shiny app development. 

#### [Regression and other stories](https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/) by Andrew Gelman, Jennifer Hill, and Aki Vehtari

Slowly reading through this book. It's been some time since I've focused on developing my modelling skills, so I was wanting to spend some more time developing in this area.  

#### [Nemesis Games (The Expanse book 5)](https://www.amazon.com/Nemesis-Games-Expanse-Book-5-ebook/dp/B00O7X626W/)

Paths to new worlds have opened for the human race. With these new paths comes the greatest land rush in human history. However, ships are mysteriously disappearing, a dangerous alien weapon has been stolen, and terrorist attacks are bringing the inner planets to their knees. I blasted through book 4, and I am interested in how the plot of this sci-fi series is going to pan out.
