<h1>Background</h1>
<p>3… 2… 1… blastoff 🚀. This <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2024/2024-04-23/readme.md">week’s</a> <code>#tidytuesday</code> dataset focuses on annual objects launched into space by various entities.</p>
<p>This data is maintained by the <a href="https://www.unoosa.org/">United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs</a>, and it is made available via the <a href="https://www.unoosa.org/oosa/osoindex/search-ng.jspx">Online Index of Objects Launched into Outer Space</a>. Objects include things like satellites, probes, landers, crewed spacecrafts, and space station flight elements launched into Earth orbit or beyond. Although this list aims to be comprehensive, it only includes launches submitted to the UN by participating nations. In addition, joint launches count as one launch for each country (i.e., counts when examined by country may be duplicated). Initially, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/yearly-number-of-objects-launched-into-outer-space">Our World in Data</a> processed this data and created an annual trend for each country.</p>
<p>Since this data is focused on country, my interest peaked by asking the following question: what is the relationship between a country’s <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/Series/Back-to-Basics/gross-domestic-product-GDP">Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</a>, a broad indicator or a country’s economic output, and objects launched into space? To answer this question, I create a scatter plot and quantify this relationship using a simple linear regression in this post.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="use-wbstats-package-to-obtain-gdp">Use <code>wbstats</code> package to obtain GDP</h2>
<p>The original dataset didn’t contain Gross Domestic Product (GDP). As such, I had to supplement it with additional data from the <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/who-we-are">World Bank</a>. The world bank makes data containing an estimate of GDP available via an API. In fact, the <a href="https://github.com/gshs-ornl/wbstats"><code>wbstats</code></a> R package provides an intuitive interface to access data via this API. Here’s the code I used to return data from the API using the <code>wbstats</code> package:</p>

<p>Since there’s a common column between these datasets, <code>code</code>, we’ll do a left join to only include GDP data for countries that launched a space object. While exploring the data, though, I noticed that the <code>data_space_objs</code> data had entities other than countries. In addition, some of the World Bank data had <code>NA</code> values present in the GDP variable. Indeed, an argument could be made to apply imputation methods to address these missing values. However, I’m just going to drop any missing values to make things easy. I do this by using the <code>drop_na()</code> function from <code>dplyr</code>.</p>

<p>With data wrangling complete, we can quickly get a sense of the shape of our data with <code>skimr</code>’s <code>skim()</code> function. What becomes immediately apparent is both the <code>num_objects</code> and <code>gdp</code> variables exhibit a distribution that is skewed to the right.</p>

<p>It’s interesting to see the R-squared value is .291, which is fairly large. This was kind of unexpected, given the complexities inherent within a country’s economy, how GDP results in the funding of space projects, and the technology and infrastructure needed to launch objects into space. Indeed, I was expecting a much smaller R-squared value. It’s also important to recognize this could be some statistical artifact, as there’s a wide discrepancy between countries. Some countries launched space objects in the single digits, while only a few launched hundereds or even thousands for some years.</p>
<p>In addition to the R-squared value, we can use the coefficients to draw further conclusions about this relationship. For instance, we can get a sense of how much GDP a country might require before launching a single object into space. Using our model estimates, it seems a country needs to have a GDP of nearly $66B dollars to begin considering launching objects into space. Another way to look at this $66B estimate is that if countries want to send more objects into space, they need to improve their GDP by this much to launch one additional object into space. Indeed, there are many factors that go into a a country’s ability to launch an object into space. However, the results from this model still give a very general estimate of the economic output a country needs to have before considering these types of projects.</p>
<p>Now that we have the model, we can go ahead and use <code>predict()</code> to append model predictions to the original data set. We can then plot those values on our original scatter plot to get a better sense of what this relationship looks like. The following code will do this for us:</p>

<section id="why-is-the-usa-so-much-further-away-from-what-is-predicted" class="level1">
<h1>Why is the USA so much further away from what is predicted?</h1>
<p>Exploring the plot, I began to question why the US doesn’t fall within what was expected from our model. My hunch is this is due to the rise in commerical space flight here in the US. In fact, here’s a couple references I came across that go into more detail about the booming commercial space industry. One such reference even goes so far to state private space flight has lead us into the fourth industrial revolution. Learn more:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/executive_briefings/ebot_us_private_space_launch_industry_is_out_of_this_world.pdf">U.S. private space launch industry is out of this world</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-space-exploration-is-fueling-the-fourth-industrial-revolution/">How space exploration is fueling the Fourth Industrial Revolution</a></li>
<li><a href="https://hbr.org/2021/02/the-commercial-space-age-is-here">The commercial space age is here</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Indeed, it’s reasonable to assume that if the US can shuttle contracts to private space companies rather than funding whole space programs to launch objects into space, then you’ll likely launch more objects than would be expected. In other words, the US government gets more bang for its buck working with commercial space companies. It’s also important to recognize that the commerical space industry makes launching objects into space more viable for companys and startups, like <a href="https://www.varda.com/">Varda Space Industries</a>, who’s <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2023/11/29/low-earth-orbit-open-for-business-varda-space-industries/">using space vehicles to manufacture pharmaceuticals</a> (seriously listen to this interesting report from <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/">Marketplace</a>).</p>
</section>
<section id="wrap-up" class="level1">
<h1>Wrap up</h1>
<p>In this post, we explored data representing objects launched into space from the <a href="https://www.unoosa.org/">United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs</a>. Specifically, we explored and found a relationship between a country’s gross domestic product and the number of objects it launches into space. This was done by creating a scatter plot and using the results from a simple linear regression. Surprisingly, it was interesting to see how the US far and away exceeded the predictions of our model. I posited and provided a few sources that attributes this result to the rise of the commercial space flight industry here in the US. I did all this while also peppering in some poorly delivered space puns, with a backdrop of some space banjo music.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed this post as much as I did writing it. This was a fun little data set. Check out the <code>#tidytuesday</code> GitHub <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday">repo</a> for other fun data sets to explore.</p>
