<section id="lets-catch-up" class="level1">
<h1>Let’s catch up</h1>
<p>Folks, welcome to Issue 014.</p>
<p>Another busy week on my end, so I struggled to find space to write and publish a post by last Thursday night. Nonetheless, I still wanted to cap off this week with an update.</p>
<p>Three topics recently caught my attention:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brands shifting their marketing campaign strategy toward ‘fashiontainment’</li>
<li>Defining the term podcast</li>
<li>Traditional marketing playbook tactics may be coming into question</li>
</ul>
<p>For a bit of fun, I share a blog post highlighting an innovation in an everyday item we don’t necessarily think about: walls–specifically drywall.</p>
<p>Let’s get into it.</p>
</section>
<section id="three-things" class="level1">
<h1>Three things</h1>
<p>Here’s what caught my attention this week:</p>
<section id="article-gap-gets-into-fashiontainment" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="article-gap-gets-into-fashiontainment"><a href="https://www.marketplace.org/story/2026/01/21/why-gap-is-investing-in-fashiontainment">Article: Gap gets into “fashiontainment”</a></h3>
<p>This article discusses a term introduced by the retailer <a href="https://www.gap.com/">Gap</a>: fashiontainment. Fashiontainment is Gap’s melding of marketing campaigns with music artists and events to blur the lines between traditional advertising and content. Why? Marketers are acutely aware consumers have become more wary of traditional advertising and the noise within this space. Some marketers for large brands are betting a mix of advertising and entertainment is a way to address these two issues. Despite this bet, the article emphasizes some expert opinion, which posits such tactics will become core to marketing strategy. Measuring sales attribution due to these large campaigns is hard to measure and can be subjective, so it limits the number of marketers willing to try this approach. The article also highlights that innovation in this space can take a lot, so many marketers have fallen into observing what works and making a copy. Take for example this <a href="https://theharrispoll.com/briefs/insurance-mascots-and-what-allstates-mayhem-shows-us-about-them/">article</a> about insurance mascots, which the article links.</p>
<section id="why-does-this-matter" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-does-this-matter">Why does this matter?</h4>
<p>The idea of blurring advertising and entertainment is what caught my attention here. Media organizations may find opportunity beyond just selling inventory, which may come from partnerships with brands turning to entertainment in an attempt to set themselves apart. However, it’s a risky strategy, especially when marketers will be challenged in terms of campaign measurement and sales attribution. Also, fashiontainment isn’t a new idea, either, which the article makes clear. Nonetheless, it’s interesting to see experimentation within the space, especially since a common strategy has been to copy what works. It makes advertising interesting again.</p>

<section id="podcast-what-even-is-a-podcast-anymore" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="podcast-what-even-is-a-podcast-anymore"><a href="https://www.bbc.com/reel/video/p0mxr47m/what-even-is-a-podcast-anymore-">Podcast: What even is a podcast anymore?</a></h3>
<p>This interview with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katty_Kay">Katty Kay</a> and <a href="https://www.searchengine.show/">PJ Vogt</a> focused on defining the term podcast. No surprise, the medium has changed significantly. Video podcasts are increasing. In fact, many people you talk to who <em>listen</em> to a podcast are most likely <em>watching</em> it. As such, the discussion included thoughts about the impact video has on the richness of the medium, which includes the conversations taking place within podcast episodes. Both the guest and host here agreed that cameras and crews significantly impact the nature of interviews and the conversations that take place. The interview then included some conversation about why podcasts are trending toward video. This includes the impact of algorithmic filtering that video platforms provide, which makes it easier for consumers to find content they might like. Lastly, the interview contained some conversation about how creators are returning to experimentation within the space, as the money and attention have cooled a bit. These two quotes from Vogt were mentioned with this point, and they are worth some further reflection:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Sometimes the least interesting time to be working an art form is at the moment where all the money shows up.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>That sometimes a little less money and a little less attention is not the worst thing for people making something.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are some interesting points I flagged as being worth a re-listen:</p>
<ul>
<li>The changes in listener experience between video and audio-only podcasts. (04m51s)</li>
<li>Consumers’ experience with discoverability in a space filled with content. (07m24s)</li>
<li>How are creators experiencing these profound changes in podcasting? (09m38s)</li>
</ul>
<section id="why-does-this-matter-1" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-does-this-matter-1">Why does this matter?</h4>
<p>I find it ironic, and frankly a bit meta, that I watched a podcast about defining what a podcast is. Nonetheless, the interview contained some interesting points. There seems to be a balance still trying to be achieved here in terms of audio-only and video podcasts. Conversations do change when a podcast is recorded for video. However, discoverability is better for the consumer due to algorithmic filtering. I also think the conversation about creators turning back toward experimentation was interesting. Perhaps the current state of the space will lead to other forms of story-telling that pushes the medium forward.</p>

<section id="event-promotion-what-stopped-working-in-marketingand-what-leaders-are-doing-instead" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="event-promotion-what-stopped-working-in-marketingand-what-leaders-are-doing-instead"><a href="https://adage.com/events-awards/gen-z-summit/aa-nextgen-marketing-best-practices-what-no-longer-works-in-2026">Event promotion: What stopped working in marketing–and what leaders are doing instead</a></h3>
<p>Despite being an event promotion, some useful points related to marketing trends were provided in this piece from <a href="https://adage.com/">AdAge</a>. The thesis is simple: many familiar marketing tactics may no longer apply and a recalibration is underway. This includes a release from marketers to be on top of every trend. The article provides several expert viewpoints mentioning that by the time you have a signal for a trend, it’s too late to act on because people are already moving on. Some perspectives shared in the article also mention 2026 is the year of being “Peak Human”, as AI is more and more being applied to reduce friction. However, authenticity requires some friction. Lastly, the article provides some thoughts on the change in strategy away from rigid targeting. Instead, some of the marketing executives stated it’s more about focusing on the creative and letting platform algorithms do the work of getting the messaging in front of the right people. For instance, from a quote in the article by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bridgetevans/">Bridget Evans</a>, Spotify’s global head of advertising business marketing:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Because overly rigid targeting can backfire. It shrinks your reach, slows learning and can have negative media efficiency consequences.</p>
</blockquote>
<section id="why-does-this-matter-2" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-does-this-matter-2">Why does this matter?</h4>
<p>The piece contains some points to note. For one, the movement away from targeting was surprising, but it makes sense. The message should be the driver of who it gets in front of, not necessarily from rigid definitions of a target audience. Platforms’ algorithms are really good at doing this, so let them do their jobs without limiting them with rigid definitions. Lastly, the comments about friction were worth some additional thought. AI certainly can be a friction reducer, even to a point where every user interaction is a custom, seemless experience. However, such friction reduction has the potential to strip away the humanness of the experience. Audiences still crave this humanness, and thus will come to expect friction to still be a part of the experience.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="blog-post-the-wonder-of-modern-drywall"><a href="https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/the-wonder-of-modern-drywall">Blog post: The wonder of modern drywall</a></h3>
<p>You ever think about walls? Me neither, but within them is an interesting story of innovation. The innovation? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drywall">Drywall</a>. The article linked above provides more background. Just the thought of not being able to hang pictures due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lath_and_plaster">lath and plaster walls</a> just seems frustrating. Thankfully drywall has been invented. Not only is it more fire resistant and easier to work with, but its invention has made our lives easier. I find enjoyment hearing about innovations to everyday things we don’t necessarily think about. You might, too. Check it out.</p>
<p>Here’s to hoping you find some innovation inspiration this week.</p>
<p>Cheers 🎉!</p>
