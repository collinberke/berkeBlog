Technology utilized includes Google Cloud resources, Docker, Apache Airflow, Google BigQuery, Google Analytics, Google Data Studio, and Shiny. The goal is to centralize and automate data processing, storage, and reporting.\n\n\nR for Data Science Online Learning Community book club facilitator\nRecently started facilitating an R for Data Science Online Learning Community online book club (check it out by joining the Slack workspace). This group is currently reading through Hadley Wickham’s Advanced R book. The group meets weekly online over Zoom. Meetings are open to anyone who is a part of the Slack group (Join the #book_club-advr channel to keep up with the book club). Check out the playlist of past meeting recordings here. I would love for more to join and be a part of this group.\n\n\nExperimenting with Neovim\nI’ve been experimenting more and more with Neovim for my development work. I’m becoming more comfortable with the different modes, movements, actions, and various tools for editing text and code. Still struggling through the configuration and plugin ecosystem to set up workflows that are the most productive. Going through this process has been a challenge, but has me really reflecting on how I approach my work, evaluating what is needed, not needed, and focusing on the bad habits I need to break."

Our aim is to start developing more Shiny applications to communicate our work and analyses. As such, we are focusing on learning the basics of Shiny app development.\n\n\nRegression and other stories by Andrew Gelman, Jennifer Hill, and Aki Vehtari\nSlowly reading through this book. It’s been some time since I’ve focused on developing my modelling skills, so I was wanting to spend some more time developing in this area.\n\n\nCaliban’s War (The Expanse Book 2) by James S.A. Corey\nFinished the first book in the series. I enjoyed the first, so I continued with the second. So far another good sci-fi read. The characters have depth, and the story is captivating. A Martian marine, a high-level politician, the Outer Planets Alliance crew of the Rocinante, and a scientist from the fallen moon of Ganymede all play an integral part in stopping an interplanetary war, while also confronting the aftereffects of an alien protomolecule now on Venus. We are not alone."
