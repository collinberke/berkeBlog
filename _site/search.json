    "text": "Collin K. Berke, Ph.D. is a media research analyst in public media. Professionally, he uses data and media/marketing research methods to answer questions on how to best reach and engage audiences–towards the goal of enriching lives and engaging minds with public media content and services. He is especially interested in the use and development of open-source statistical software (i.e. Rstats) to achieve this goal, and developing a broader understanding the role these tools can play in media, digital, and marketing analytics.\nHe has experience using different software, third-party services, and programming languages from developing several analytics projects, both in industry and academia. In regards to programming languages, he has developed projects using R, SQL, $bash, and a little bit of Python. He also has extensive experience using different analytics solutions. For data warehousing, he mostly uses database tools like Postgres and those in the Google Cloud Platform ecosystem (e.g., Google BigQuery). When it comes to automating workflows and data pipelines, he has experience implementing and working with Apache Airflow. He also has extensive experience using third-party tools and software to analyze, wrangle data, and communicate his analyses (e.g., Google Analytics, Google Sheets, Excel, Google Data Studio, and R Shiny). Most of his current work is industry related.\nCollin also serves as an adjunct instructor for the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and Southeast Community College, where he teaches courses in sports data visualization and analysis and communication specific courses. He holds a M.A. in Communication Studies from the The University of South Dakota and a Ph.D. in Media and Communication from Texas Tech University. He has also published and contributed to the publication of several academic journal articles.\nCollin is a self-proclaimed news, sports, and podcast junkie. He really enjoys listening to NPR, watching PBS (especially NOVA), and indulging in college football and baseball. At times, he will write blog posts on topics he finds interesting in these areas.\nCheck out the Now page to see what Collin is currently reading and working on."

    "text": "Projects I’m working on\n\nProject Conduit\nCurrently developing and maintaining a data pipeline project built using R and Python. Technology utilized includes Google Cloud resources, Docker, Apache Airflow, Google BigQuery, Google Analytics, Google Data Studio, and Shiny. The goal is to centralize and automate data processing, storage, and reporting.\n\n\nR for Data Science Online Learning Community book club facilitator\nRecently started facilitating an R for Data Science Online Learning Community online book club (check it out by joining the Slack workspace). This group is currently reading through Hadley Wickham’s Advanced R book. The group meets weekly online over Zoom. Meetings are open to anyone who is a part of the Slack group (Join the #book_club-advr channel to keep up with the book club). Check out the playlist of past meeting recordings here. I would love for more to join and be a part of this group.\n\n\nExperimenting with Neovim\nI’ve been experimenting more and more with Neovim for my development work. I’m becoming more comfortable with the different modes, movements, actions, and various tools for editing text and code. Still struggling through the configuration and plugin ecosystem to set up workflows that are the most productive. Going through this process has been a challenge, but has me really reflecting on how I approach my work, evaluating what is needed, not needed, and focusing on the bad habits I need to break."

Our aim is to start developing more Shiny applications to communicate our work and analyses. As such, we are focusing on learning the basics of Shiny app development.\n\n\nRegression and other stories by Andrew Gelman, Jennifer Hill, and Aki Vehtari\nSlowly reading through this book. It’s been some time since I’ve focused on developing my modelling skills, so I was wanting to spend some more time developing in this area.\n\n\nAbaddon’s Gate (The Expanse, 3)\nI’ve taken up reading the third book in the Expanse series. A breakneck science fiction adventure that continues to follow Earth, Mars, and the Outer Planets Alliances’ mission to explore a massive alien artifact, which seems to be a gate leading to a starless, dark dimension. Is this gate an opportunity or a threat? Or is the greatest threat among those sent to examine this paradigm shattering object?"
