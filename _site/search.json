    "text": "Background\nI’ve really been focusing on developing a daily writing habit. As a result, I’ve been actively generating ideas on how to more frequently publish blog content. My biggest mental hurdle for turning posts around is a deeply embedded feeling that every piece of writing I produce needs to be polished prose, and everything included needs to be absent of error.\n\n\nLinks and thoughts on link blogging\nI recently came across this quote from an interview with Simon Willison on the Real Python podcast with Christopher Bailey (the quote is mentioned around 10m08s):\n\nCredibility is accumulated over time, and it doesn’t take much, like a link blog about a subject run that for six months and you will become one of the top 0.1% people on earth with credibility on that subject just from publishing a few notes and linking to a bunch of things about it.\n\nI found Willison’s statement motivating, inspiring, and a little freeing. It made me reconsider portions of my own blog and what’s their aim. This is my little corner the internet, and I set the expectations and rules of this site.\nCertainly, I believe there is room for more formal, well thought-out forms of writing, like you can read in the blog section of my site. However, I also see the Today I Learned (TIL) section of my site being more like a link blog, a scratch-pad of sorts, and at times a research notebook on topics I’m learning about. Learning is a messy endeavour some times, so why does every piece of writing from it need to be tidy? It doesn’t.\n\n\nMini-blogging and open-source ecosystems\nKelli Bodwin addressed these same ideas during her posit::conf(2024) talk. The talk contained a call to action for attendees to produce more content, even if they weren’t fully formed topics or ideas. Just sharing what you’ve currently learned or are working on strengthens open-source ecosystems and makes them more sustainable. David Robinson’s Rstudio::conf(2019) keynote The unreasonable effectiveness of public work was also referenced, which I have queued up to watch later. Although I suggest listening to Bodwin’s entire talk, you can hear more about these specific ideas around 13m20s.\nWho knows where these thoughts may lead. I’m still learning, which is the most important.\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0CitationBibTeX citation:@misc{berke2025,\n  author = {Berke, Collin K},\n  title = {Notes on Link Blogs and More Frequent Blog Posting},\n  date = {2025-01-26},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nBerke, Collin K. 2025. “Notes on Link Blogs and More Frequent Blog\nPosting.” January 26, 2025."

    "text": "Projects I’m working on\n\nTransitioning to LazyVim\nAs of my last update, I decided to burn down my Neovim setup and start over. I was in search of something more enjoyable and manageable to work with. I came across LazyVim and started to really enjoy it. Out of the box it had sane defaults and configurations, so the setup was minimal and I’ve found it more enjoyable to work with. LazyVim Extras also make it easy to install and configure different plugins.\n\n\nBlogging more\nI’m attempting to increase the publishing of my blog posts. I was following a cadance of roughly posting every month. I want to bump this up to two a month, with a stretch goal being every week. The hardest parts are being realistic with myself, identifying shorter post topics to write about, and being kinder to myself. Writing posts with a tighter turn-around means embracing progress over perfection.\n\n\nThinking about the use of data and organizational culture\nMore and more often I’m being tasked with stratigizing how to improve the role and impact data has within an organization. These are not easy questions to answer. I’ve been doing a lot of exploring and experimentation. If anyone has any suggestions, let’s chat.\nIf you’re interested in what I’ve focused on in the past, check out my past updates"

Although I’m up-to-date on most of the basics and am usually pretty good at completing straight-forward queries, it was a good time to focus and become even more proficient with the language. So, we picked up this book to learn more.\n\n\nR for Data Science (2e) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund\nCurrently, I’m leading another Data Science Learning Community bookclub meeting for this book. I haven’t read the second edition yet, so I’m excited to see and learn what’s new.\n\n\nWith the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa by E.B. Sledge\nThis is a personal read I pick up from time to time. I finished watching the HBO miniseries Band of Brothers and The Pacific, which were based on first hand accounts in books like this. With the Old Breed is a first-hand account of one serviceman’s experience on the frontline during operations in the Pacific Theater, specifically in Peleliu and Okinawa, during World War II. It’s unfathomable to comprehend the experiences and hardships many endured. Reading it has made me more deeply appreciate the sacrafices men and women of the armed services make for the United States of America.\n\n\nProfessional development reads\n\nMachine Learning with R - Fourth Edition by Brett Lantz\n\n\nPractical Tableau by Ryan Sleeper\n\n\nHBR Guide to Making Every Meeting Matter from the Harvard Business Review\n\n\nThe Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right by Atul Gawande\n\n\nTidy Modeling with R by Max Kuhn and Julia Silge\n\n\nPython for Data Analysis by Wes McKinney\n\n\nEngineering Production-Grade Shiny Apps by Colin Fay, Sébastien Rochette, Vincent Guyader, and Cervan Girard\n\n\nAdvanced R by Hadley Wickham.
