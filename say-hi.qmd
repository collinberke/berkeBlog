I want to meet you. Yeah, you!

I've set aside time on my calendar for 30-60 minute conversations over coffee, lunch, or other suggestions.
These conversations can be virtual or in person if you're in my area (Lincoln or Omaha, NE).

# What can our time together be used for?

Whatever you want.
Are you working as a data scientist, analyst, or any other type of professional in media or marketing?
Let's talk shop.
Have an idea or blocker you want to discuss?
I'm open to sharing objective, external feedback.
Wrestling with a tricky piece of code?
I might be able to help, or at the very least could be an extra hand in Googling or AI'ing your problem.
Have a presentation you want to practice?
With my background in communication and public speaking, I'd be glad to listen and offer guidance.
Want to spend 10 minutes screaming into the void of the internet and head out?
I'm open to that to.

To be clear, I'm not selling anything.
My intention with this time is connection and networking, and it's not to push a sales pitch or demo.

If any of this sounds interesting, schedule a time and come say hi!

# My interests

If you need specifics, the topics I'd like to talk more about include:
