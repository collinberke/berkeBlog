# Let's catch up

Howdy folks!

Welcome to Issue 009.

Three topics caught my attention this week:
To end the week with a little fun, 

Let's get into it.

# Three things from this week

Here are three things that caught my attention:

### [As AI Eats Web Traffic, Don’t Panic—Evolve](https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/as-ai-eats-web-traffic-dont-panic-evolve)

Past updates have highlighted [Google Zero](https://www.theverge.com/24167865/google-zero-search-crash-housefresh-ai-overviews-traffic-data-audience)
Google Zero has been cited for eating web traffic, which in part is being attributed to the rollout of AI summaries.
As a result, digital industry professionals are assessing whether the SEO handbook still applies in the age of Generative Engine Optimization (GEO).
This article, from [KelloggInsight](https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/) provides some direction and advice for practitioners.
These include: focusing on engagement rather than count metrics; focusing strategy and budget on experimentation; and further developing personalized experiences.

#### Why does this matter?

Although this is a moment of disruption, this is not a new or novel mode for the marketing and advertising industry.
Search, since the beginning, has always gone through changes.
Rather than viewing this as an industry killing event, it should be thought more as a realignment.
A realignment toward a renewed focus on the purpose of websites: connect people with information.
This quote from the article puts it best:

> But even if users don’t click through from AI summaries or personalized newsletters, Cutler thinks adapting to this new era of optimization might just mean getting back to the original purpose of websites: connecting people with information.

### [I've Watched Three "Revolutions" transform advertising. Here's what actually changed](https://beth-egan.com/ive-watched-three-revolutions-transform-advertising-heres-what-actually-changed/)

This short blog post provides a viewpoint on the impact technical revolutions have had on the advertising industry.
It acknowledges several of these changes over the years: the introduction of the internet in the 1990's; programatic ad sales in the 2000's; and now AI.
Despite all these revolutions, the post re-orients advertising professionals toward a focus on the fundamentals.
These include understanding your audience, development and execution of strategy, critical thinking, understanding human psychology, and asking better questions with our data.

#### Why does this matter?

Technology will always change.
Disruption will happen.
The ways media professionals work will be impacted.
But, the fundamentals remain the same.
AI is not a replacement, but rather a tool to further assist in executing industry fundamentals.
An important fundamental is to understand your audience, so you can develop the media and experiences they will truly engage with.

### [Screencasting Is Gone. Bundles Are Breaking. The TV Ecosystem Is Locking Down](https://tvnewscheck.com/business/article/screencasting-is-gone-bundles-are-breaking-the-tv-ecosystem-is-locking-down/)

This article provides a relevant perspective on the impact large platform packaging and levels of access will have on local broadcaster's protections allowing for reach, visibility, and stability.
The article posits that the industry is moving toward a state of television lockdown.
That is:

> Together, they signal the television lock-down — a shift toward platform-controlled devices, curated bundles and tightly managed viewing environments. Openness is no longer a feature.

In fact, the larger point made in the article is that this is a signal that platforms now decide how television is assembeled and promoted, not broadcasters.
Such a switch has major implications on local broadcasters, who in the past had structural boundaries that provided protections from platform influence.
These will only lead streaming platforms to further harden their control over discovery, content availability, the playback surface, and forms of content monetization that are more predictable.
There's also some conversation about how these larger platform offerings influence audience's expectations, which broadcaster's may not be able to meet.
