# Background

[This week's TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2025/2025-08-05/readme.md) included data exploring Income Inequality Before and After Taxes.
The article ["Income inequality before and after taxes: how much do countries redistribute income?"](https://ourworldindata.org/income-inequality-before-and-after-taxes) by Joe Hasell inspired this week's data.
The data were processed by [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org), and they orignated from various sources (see the [documentation](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2025/2025-08-05/readme.md) for more info).

The data provides an estimate called the Gini coefficient for both before and after taxes.
Here's the definition:

> The Gini coefficient measures inequality on a scale from 0 to 1. Higher values indicate higher inequality.
> Inequality is measured here in terms of income before and after taxes and benefits.

# My contribution

Here is my contribution for the week of 2025-08-05:

![](vis-income-inequality-dumbell.gif){width=500 height=500 fig-align="center"}

The code I used to produce this animated plot follows.

You can also access the code via my TidyTuesday GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/collinberke/berkeTidyTuesday).

[Here](https://github.com/collinberke/berkeTidyTuesday/blob/main/2025/2025-08-05/2025-08-05.R) is the code for this specific contribution.

#   * Range of data points per country?
#   * Over what years does this data represent?

# I found this useful because the rendering of the animation can take some time.
# Having this static plot allowed for faster iteration.
