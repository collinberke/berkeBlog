* Media Research Analyst at Nebraska Public Media (member station of PBS & NPR).
* Goal is to use data to answer questions on how to best reach and engage audiences.
* Developing open source tools and utilizing cloud computing resources to achieve this goal.

## Keeping public media RAD 😎
My team's aim:

* **R**eproducible
* **A**utomated
* **D**ocumented and effectively communicated

## How does my group stay RAD?

* Public media already has some rad content and services ...
  - Check us out: [NebraskaPublicMedia.org](https://www.nebraskapublicmedia.org)
* My team also works on some pretty RAD projects:
  - Internal R packages for audience and marketing research.
  - Automating our work with the Google Cloud Platform.
  - Developing Shiny apps for business intelligence.
  - Utilizing Quarto for reporting.

## Teaching R

* Partnering with the College of Journalism and Mass Communication (COJMC) and Matt Waite
* Teach SPMC 350: Sports Data Visualization and Analysis
* **Goal:** Convert R beginners to R users
* Introduce R >> Wrangling >> Analysis >> Visualization >> Publish original work online

## Data Science Learning Community

* A welcoming place to get help and learn more about data science.
* We're known for our book clubs.
* I'm an active member and facilitator.
* I'm also leading a cohort for R4DS (2e).

## Connect with me!

* I want to meet everyone, but I'm interested in speaking with:
  - R Users and R Developers leveraging R in business.
  - People who teach R.
  - Anyone trying to be RAD by using R.
* If we don't get a chance to meet in person, let's connect online.
